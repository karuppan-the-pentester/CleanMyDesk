# CleanMyDesk
A basic shell script to clean the caches

I create seperate partition for root and home, so i use this script when my root shitted with full of unwanteds 
Sometimes i fucked by deleting the working docker images without commiting the data in it to git 

;-( 

I'll update that later becasue my PC is now free space, when i get sued again i'll change the script.
